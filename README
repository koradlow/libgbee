Library for handling XBee / XBee-PRO RF modules.
The library is written in C and supports the following platforms: 
Linux (x86, MIPSel), Windows (x86), AT91 SAM7 microcontrollers.

This is a fork from the official libgebee V0.3.0 that can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libgbee/

This fork adds compability with C++ compilers and makes the library
compatible with the latest changes in the XBee protocol

To build the library the CMake build system is being used. Check the
doxygen documentation for detailled instructions.
